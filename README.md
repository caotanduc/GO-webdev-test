## project checklist
Must have:
- [x] Display all products in Our Products section (for products data please check from Technical Requirements):
    - [x] Single product should have name, description, price, image and Add To Cart button.
    - [x] User able to click on Add To Cart to add target product to their cart.
    - [x] Added product doesn't have Add To Cart button anymore, it should have Check Mark Icon (âœ“) instead.
- [x] Display all added products in Your Cart section:
    - [x] Each product in cart should have name, price, image, increase/decrease amount button and remove button.
    - [x] User able to increase/decrease amount of a product in cart. When product's amount is decreased to zero, that product will be removed from cart naturally.
    - [x] User able to remove product from cart.
    - [x] Show total price of all products in car. When user increase/decrease product's amount or remove product, total price should be re-calculate correctly.
    - [x] When there are no products in cart, we should show Your cart is empty message.
    - [x] Products in cart should be persistent: When user visit the application, products are added before should be showed, user don't need to add products again.
    - [x] UI must follow correctly design from live demo.
Nice to have:
- [x] Responsive design (look good on all devices: desktops, tablets & mobile phones).
- [ ] Smooth animations (don't really need to be same as the demo, just do what you think is good).
- [x] Deploy the application to ~~heroku~~ [render.com](render.com).
